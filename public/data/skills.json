I believe communication is key to a successful working relationship whether it's explaining a tricky technical concept to somebody, giving a presentation, asking for assistance or even just providing an update on the current status of a project. I pride myself on my ability to tailor my approach to the target audience and preventing any miscommunication from occurring.</p>"

Systems were vital for the staff and students to perform to their best which meant that the system needed to be reliable and robust. Maintenance is key in reducing problems but an ability to provide a rapid response to any unforeseen events means that I've learnt to think quickly and calmly, finding the correct solution despite often stressful circumstances.</p>"
