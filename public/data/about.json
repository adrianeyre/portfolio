I've enjoyed working as a systems administrator over 13 years and software developer for 3 years.</p><p>My GitHub account has multiple working examples of Ruby, C#, Python, PHP, TypeScript, JavaScript and VB Script projects that are all open source. Some example of these projects are Twitter, Instagram, Yelp, Pacman and the bowling challenge. These examples all show good software craftsmanship such as the SOLID principles, Object Orientated Design, XP values, clean DRY code and RESTful APIâ€™s.</p><p>I am competent in using Test Driven Design frameworks such as Rspec, NUnit, XUnit, Mocha, Capybara and Jasmine and have even written my own test framework using Javascript. I can work in an agile environment and take part in daily stand ups, weekly retrospectives and regular code reviews in order to help others and to better myself.</p><p>I am also competent in frameworks such as React, Angular, Sinatra, Rails, Node Server and am highly efficient in MVC architecture. I have over 13 years commercial experience of MS SQL Server, Oracle databases using CRUD commands, MS Server, MS Exchange, MS MDT, Windows support and I am an Oracle Certified Associate.</p><p>I have worked effectively as part of a team, paired programming or individually using version control through GitHub and TeamCity. I believe I am a well-rounded team member that will fit into any organisation with minimal disruption. I have commercial experience in the whole software development life cycle producing software from creation to completion."
